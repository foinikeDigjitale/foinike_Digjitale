The files contained in this repository feature the scripts and resources for an interactive map of the archaeological site of Phoenike in Albania. The interactive map was created using the open-source Javascript library Leaflet and is intended to work best on mobile devices.This project was financed by the Ministry of Culture of Albania (Ministria e Kulturës) and was designed and created by Sabian Hasani and Tyler Duane Johnson with the support of the Albanian Ministry of Culture and the Albanian-Italian Archaeological Mission at Phoenike. The map may be viewed freely here: https://foinikedigjitale.github.io/foinike_Digjitale/harta/Reproduction of this map and/or any of its components (including but not limited to associated scripts, written content, images, etc.), except those shared exclusively by Leaflet as part of its free, open-source API, is forbidden without the explicit consent of the content creators.26/10/2021
